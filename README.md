Everything you need inside your browser for editing text/code.

The first requirement was:
- display line number

Later I created
- cut and paste functionality that maintained the correct line numbers.

The next milestone should make you able to:
- load and save text-files

Unfortunately I found at this point, that it is not possible to display a list of local files in every browser with plain HTML & JS.
